# Machine Learning Project

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms and concepts. The project is organized into subdirectories for Neural Networks and Optimization techniques.

## Subdirectories

- [Neural Networks](./Neural%20Networks/README.md): This subdirectory contains implementations of different types of neural networks, including Perceptron, ADALINE, MLP Regressor, and MLP Classifier.

- [Optimization](./Optimization/README.md): This subdirectory covers various optimization techniques such as Steepest Descent, Linear Minimization, Newton's Method, and Conjugate Gradient method.

## Usage

Each subdirectory contains its own set of implementations and explanatory notes. To explore the implementations and learn more about each concept, navigate to the respective subdirectory's README.md file.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and contribute to this machine learning project.
